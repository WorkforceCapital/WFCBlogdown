Ten years of experience in the field, my purpose is to help Quebec and Canadian companies to be leaders in people analytics.
 
I have strong analytical skills, coupled with expertise in gathering and organizing large amounts of both structured and unstructured data. I use my analytical mindset to translate business needs to working hypotheses using theory and practical knowledge. On that basis, I can interpret intricate knowledge into tangible and strategic decision making.
