Ten years of experience in the field, my purpose is to help Quebec and Canadian companies to be leaders in people analytics.
 
I have strong analytical skills, coupled with expertise in gathering and organizing large amounts of both structured and unstructured data. I use my analytical mindset to translate business needs to working hypotheses using theory and practical knowledge. On that basis, I can interpret intricate knowledge into tangible and strategic decision making.
 
My goal is to bring my future clients that are C-suite level as well as the functional level to realize their alignment of business and talent, creating analytical tools to inform executive decision making and implement change programs to support business transformation efforts.
