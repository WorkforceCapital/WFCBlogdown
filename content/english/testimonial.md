- content: I had the chance to be Badr's client on the Workday Implementation project at Desjardins.
He provided high value consulting while at the same time, supporting operations alongside the project's team to implement Workday.
His knowledge on Workforce planning and BI goes from the technological aspects to the strategic concepts, always looking forward.
Without a doubt I recommend Badr for your business projects if you want alignment and delivery.
